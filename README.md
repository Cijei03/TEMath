TEMath is project where I learned some mathemathic required for 3D rendering. It allows for arithmetical operations on 2, 3 and 4 elemental vectors, doing transforms with matrix 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4.
On last mentioned matrix I implemented extra methods, such as creating projection matrixes (perspective and orthogonal). Additionally I implemented AVX and AVX2 support for faster math,
but while benchmarking it was as fast as SIMD assembly generated by gcc compiler, so I decided to remove manual SIMD support.
